Description
===========
fritzident is a program that is amending the parental control function of
the AVM Fritz!Box. It mimics the standard AVM Windows application that allows
the Fritz!Box to recognize individual users connecting to the Internet.
This application is supposed to run under control of inetd or systemd.

General Information
===================
fritzident will run as an stand alone server. The provided Makefile can be used
to compile the program. Obviously, a the make utility, a C compiler and base C
libraries need to be installed for this to work.
Compilation had initially been tested on Ubuntu 15.04.
It currently is known to compile and run on openSUSE 42.3.

Installation
============
To install fritzident, copy the executable program to an appropriate location
or use 'make install' to copy it into /usr/local/sbin. Start the server after
establishing the network services. You can use the provided systemd unit files
or the init.d script. An inetd is no longer needed.

Security
========
The intent of this service is to disclose information about the internal
configuration of the machine!

So if you do not need this service, do not install and start it!

But as you are reading this page, you probably see a need to make use of this
service. Just keep in mind, that once this service is running, the AVM
Fritz!Box is not the only one knowing how to connect to this service. You may
want to configure a narrow rule into your machine's local firewall to only
allow traffic from your AVM Fritz!Box to the port of this service and vice
versa.

Internal working
================
At startup fritzident is creating a socket on the port 14013 and sends out a
prompt message, then waits for a single command, and sends the response. The
prompt message is "AVM IDENT", and is required for the Fritz!Box to recognize
the service.

Recognized commands:
	USERS		return a list of known users
	TCP ip:port	return name of the user for the specified local TCP port
	UDP ip:port	idem, but for UDP ports

The prompt, as well as all replies, are terminated by a CR & NL (ASC 13 + ASC
10). Commands are recognized with either CR & NL or just NL line termination.
This allows fritzident to be tested interactively.
